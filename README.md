# This simulation is how many Anti-Neutrinos are being emitted in the body from K-40 in the human body each SECOND!

# Approximately 3,333 atoms of K-40 decay in the body each SECOND!

# This project is specifically on Beta - Decay of K-40!

# If you want to use the code, please notify me about it! If you do, I'll be happy to give you permission!
